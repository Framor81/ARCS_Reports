| 06/19 | Worked on the UE5 blueprint and fixed a lot of the bugs that we had, tested more of the OSC utility in unreal engine 5 and learned Anjali couldn't send messages to my UE5, tried to get a working camera taking screenshots of the robot's front view, read through Liz's weekly reports, watched the Weight and Bias videos, rewatched some of fastai video #3, and started working on image+command model.

# Activities
- I had a bug in the blueprint that when I interrupt a command while its still ongoing it makes the target degree be incorrect. I fixed this by updating the target degrees as soon as a command is called.
- I was having an issue where turning right would sometimes make it spin for ever. This was easily fixed by making any target above 360 into its equivalent angle between 0-360.
- I then started facing an issue where turning to a certain angle through open sound control would cause it to spin forever, this was fixed by adding a set bool statement when is a command is called that allows for the check to see if were are done turning to be checked every tick and stop us when needed.
- I then had Anjali see if she could send commands from her machine to my unreal engine, but she was not able to. I put this to the side, so I could Ask Clark tomorrow during our whole team meeting.

- I tried looking to ways to take screenshot of the front of the robot's view, but I am currently struggling without setting it up in the level blueprint. Anjali found a way that does it through our normal chaos vehicle camera viewport, but I don't think we can specify the filename with this so I'll keep looking into ways we can do this.
- I watched the Weight and Bias youtube videos
- Rewatched some of fastai video #3 
- I looked through Liz's github reports from last year to see how they tackled taking images in unreal engine, but didn't find specifically how they accomplished taking the pictures.
- I then started on making an image+command model that works on 2ndRunHighRes
# Issues

- It looks like the commands are one command behind when given a degrees to rotate. I fixed it by reorganizing the order of execution of the OSC messages. I made it so degrees is called first and then right after it'll execute the command, just to ensure no errors arise.
- Robot would keep turning left on inclines because gravity would pull it and the tick would miss the moment in which our target = our current angle. I fixed this by getting rid of the tick delay checking our position
- I tried opening the newly updated Oldenburg model, but I got an error
