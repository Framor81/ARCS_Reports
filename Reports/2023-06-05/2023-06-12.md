# Summary

| Date  | Notes
| :---- | :----
| 06/05 | Whole Teem meeting on tasks for the week, kept working with model of ARCS lab in TwinMotion, learned about soldering and some electronics, updated report for today's part, had another whole group meeting
| 06/06 | Whole team meeting on using twinmotion and the differences between it and UE5, read the articles on pair programming, read the lab's previous research papers, tried exporting my twinmotion model to UE5, worked on creating my own AI model following FastAI video's

# Activities
- Had a whole group meeting where we discussed our responsibilities for the week.
- Continued exploring TwinMotion and modeling the ARCS Lab.
- Explored the electronics side by attempting to get a DC motor working.
- Continued working in TwinMotion exploring it's features and limitations
- Had another whole group meeting where I talked about my experiences using TwinMotion and my thoughts on it as a modeling software
- Continued working with FastAI and reading its documentation

## ARC Lab in TwinMotion Continued

- A helpful video when starting in TwinMotion https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyjifEilI9A

- I continued modeling the lab, this time focusing on the main lab room and Anjali's office

- Below I have attached a video that shows the entirety of the lab

- After finishing my model I attempted to export this model to UE5
- In order to do this I had to export it as a Datasmith file

- I then had to install some plugins for UE5 to even allow me to import these types of files

- However, it turns out the plugins were only available in 5.1 UE so I had to install it, in order to import the ARCS lab model

- After importing, the lights were non-functional and there was no simple fix. According, to the web it was a known issue that lighting may break when importing from DataSmith files

# Issues

- TwinMotion does not allow for one to edit geometry or make fine adjustments

- Inability to clearly edit objects in a group after some time

- Meant to be used along with a CAD software

- No easy way to export and import between TwinMotion and UE5
