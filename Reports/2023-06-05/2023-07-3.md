- I read documentation on OSC servers and found more information about dispatchers
- I redid some of the python script I had already started working on
- I met with Prof Clark and discussed my current plans, some feedback, and got assistance with the direction I should approach boxnav.
- I was having an issue with assigning the values python received to a variable, but I was able to fix it by making the Dispatch handler into a class as class variables
- I kept working on the python file until I got to the request image. At this point I was unable to find an effective way to get OSC to send the image into python for it to be read.
    - This was a lot harder than expected. Currently looking into turning it into a 2D texture, and from this we can create a binary array which when made into a str or tuple should be be able to be messaged to python.
- I finished up the script on the server side from unreal engine, so now once I finish the blueprint, we'll be able to send messages as needed.
