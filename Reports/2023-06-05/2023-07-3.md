# Summary

| :---- | :----
| 06/26 | I read on OSC servers and dispatchers to try to get unreal to communicate with python, I got some instructions to how I should continue working and got told I should look into boxnav in order to continue approaching replacing ue5env with our ue5osc python script, I finished working on the simple commands for python to command unreal engine.
| 06/27 | I continued working on getting unreal engine to send messages to a terminal, then to python, I fixed some of the code in the OSC Sender __init__ so it would work unreal engine, I created a new python file where our dispatcher would actively listen and return the correct items to the correct place, and I finished all blueprints from the __init__ script. I added comments to my scripts
| 06/28 | I tried out my osc python script and found out that it didn't work, spent time debugging it and getting it to work and communicate as needed, had a whole team meeting where we discussed our progress, met with Anjali, Chau, and Daisy to decide what software we would be using for modeling, and lastly looked more into trying to send images to OSC by making them into binary.

- I read documentation on OSC servers and found more information about dispatchers
- I redid some of the python script I had already started working on
- I met with Prof Clark and discussed my current plans, some feedback, and got assistance with the direction I should approach boxnav.
- I was having an issue with assigning the values python received to a variable, but I was able to fix it by making the Dispatch handler into a class as class variables
- I kept working on the python file until I got to the request image. At this point I was unable to find an effective way to get OSC to send the image into python for it to be read.
    - This was a lot harder than expected. Currently looking into turning it into a 2D texture, and from this we can create a binary array which when made into a str or tuple should be be able to be messaged to python.
- I finished up the script on the server side from unreal engine, so now once I finish the blueprint, we'll be able to send messages as needed. 10

- I watched another tutorial on getting images into binary and sending it across osc.
- Continued debugging the __init__ code for OSCSender
- Worked on the blueprint to the point where the necessary information would be sent into the client if it was working.
- OSC Client on Unreal Engine's side wasn't sending anything over to terminal or python, so I looked into why this was the case.
- The ports of the client and server must be different, and  the function doesn't accurately work because the target for sending messages and the client itself aren't compatible as an input to a custom event to fix this I had to delete the old OSC client variable that I had and remake a new one. This fixed the issue.
- Next, I finished all the blueprints to work as intended when we run the new commands. Unreal Engine was able to send the necessary information.
- I then tried making demo.py receive information to test whether python would work.
- I was able to get it to start receiving information, but there are moment where the terminal dies and it doesn't allow me to rerun the code, edit the script, or even kill it. This happened when I was attempting to create a timer for the server so it wouldn't indefinitely lock me out while I was debugging.

- Had a whole team meeting where we discussed our work from last, we then discussed pros and cons of each modeling software and which one we want to stick to, and talked about plans for the model.
- I then went to Oldenburg and gathered some final measurements.
- I packaged the game for windows and for mac. This new package had a couple of updates:
    - The first of which was I fixed the communication between unreal engine and it's client which allowed it to return data to any server that was listening. 
    - I then created a couple of new commands to work with the boxnav code. These commands are the following:
        - /get/location - returns the current location of the actor
        - /get/rotation - returns the current rotation of the actor
        - /set/location - Input: string "x, y, z" - sets the current location of the actor
        - /set/rotation - Input: string "pitch, roll, yaw" - sets the current rotation the actor
        - /get/project - returns the current name of the level
        
- Port 7448 didn't work as the client for some reason
- I researched ways to try to send images into a byte array to be able to send it through OSC
- Me and Anjali sat down and I explained my code and what everything did.
    - We then debugged a bit of the code where values weren't being correctly updated. We fixed this by reseting the values to none so the while loop acting as a delay still functions even when it's not the first time calling a function.
    - I added to my reports, and helped Anjali with joining meshes in blender.


# Issues
- The python script keeps getting stuck, requiring me to kill the terminal to even run the code again. No return values are being assigned even though it is receiving information from unreal engine.
- We were able to fix it by setting a delay for the dispatcher to actually return the values before moving on to the code and returning none
