## Figuring out TwinMotion
- Read the Quick start guide explaining the different areas on TwinMotion's interface

# Issues

*Solved*
- Computer speaker's weren't working and when I first tried to launch Unreal Engine 5 I got the following error:

![GPU Error for UE5](Assets/6-01-2023.png)

- I found that the GPU wasn't even being detected by the computer in the first place and was instead using microsoft graphics.
- Prof Clark helped me troubleshoot and we decided to install and update the necessary drivers for the NVIDIA quadro p6000 through geforce experience. This instillation of the gpu drivers actually ended up fixing the audio on the monitor as well.
- While following along in the Open Sound Control Video I got the following error:

![OSC Error](Assets/6-02-2023.png)

- With help from Prof Clark we fixed the first error by deleting a copy of the blueprint I had originally made and then connecting one of the nodes on Bind Event that was not connected.

# Plans

My main plain for the upcoming week is to:
- follow a TwinMotion tutorial that teaches me how to model a room or something similar
- Take pictures of the lab and try to model in TwinMotion
- Watch fastai video 2
