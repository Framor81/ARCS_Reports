# Summary

| Date  | Notes
| :---- | :----
| 07/03 | Had a whole team meeting where we discussed our progress, and had whole group code review, worked with Anjali to fix the suggestions, tried them in unreal engine, edited the blueprint, met with Clark for another smaller code review, committed and pushed changes to ue5osc and unreal project to github and gitea respectively, I watched Youtube video on keeping blueprints organized,

 # Activities
- The while loop in wait_for_response does not work as Intended because we got rid of self.values and by checking for it, it'll always be false, as we are never updating it.
- We finished peer programming and editing the needed suggestions.
- We then received more feedback from Prof Clark, and I worked to continue working on them. There were some things that we left as we had like the wait_for_response and assigning self.values even though we return x, y, z.
- I started editing the blueprint to ensure it worked with all commands.
- I pulled the changes from Gitea and edited the blueprint to be up to date with my main one. I then committed my changes and pushed them.
- I watched the Youtube video on tips for organizing blueprints
    * This video talked about a multitude of tips:
    1. _Marketplace Plugins_: Plugins that make organization easier.
    2. _Reroute Nodes_: We can reroute lines to make them more readable
    3. _Sequence Nodes_: We can make branches that look more organized
    4. _Enum and Switch Cases_: Better if else statements that are more compact.
    5. Straighten Nodes (Alignment): Arrow keys, drag with mouse, or you can right click and chose align.
    6. Consistent Node Layout: Keep smaller nodes organized in a consistent manner.
    7.  Make Functions: You can create functions to make nodes less overwhelming. We can also create local variables for them.
    8. Collapse Nodes: Hides Nodes in one collapsed node area.
    9.  Set Timer by function name: Kind of works like a delay for functions.
    10. Select Node: Change variables only once.
    11. Comments: Super Useful, TEMP, FIXME, TODO, OPTIMIZE
    12. Custom Events: Super useful work like functions and allow us to get nodes in the same blueprint in its own section.
    13. Actor Components: Useful for shared functionality.
    14. Blueprint Function  Libraries: Functionality not tied to one object, kind of like utility functions. Can be called from all blueprints.
    15. Parents/Child Inheritance: Can Make changes to a child that has same properties as parent, but you can make changes to its mesh and more.

- I plan to package the game for Mac and Windows and get it working for Mac
