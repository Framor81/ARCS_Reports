# Summary

| Date  | Notes
| :---- | :----
| 07/03 | Had a whole team meeting where we discussed our progress, and had whole group code review, worked with Anjali to fix the suggestions, tried them in unreal engine, edited the blueprint, met with Clark for another smaller code review, committed and pushed changes to ue5osc and unreal project to github and gitea respectively, I watched Youtube video on keeping blueprints organized,
| 07/04 | Watched every video in the WandB course on effective mlops models, tried following along with the videos but got a permission error, tried fixing it for a long while before eventually deciding to move on from it. Read documentation on fastai and ddg images to gather data and practice the process of collecting it and classifying. Repackaged windows and mac game.

 # Activities
- The while loop in wait_for_response does not work as Intended because we got rid of self.values and by checking for it, it'll always be false, as we are never updating it.
- We finished peer programming and editing the needed suggestions.
- We then received more feedback from Prof Clark, and I worked to continue working on them. There were some things that we left as we had like the wait_for_response and assigning self.values even though we return x, y, z.
- I started editing the blueprint to ensure it worked with all commands.
- I pulled the changes from Gitea and edited the blueprint to be up to date with my main one. I then committed my changes and pushed them.
- I watched the Youtube video on tips for organizing blueprints
    * This video talked about a multitude of tips:
    1. _Marketplace Plugins_: Plugins that make organization easier.
    2. _Reroute Nodes_: We can reroute lines to make them more readable
    3. _Sequence Nodes_: We can make branches that look more organized
    4. _Enum and Switch Cases_: Better if else statements that are more compact.
    5. Straighten Nodes (Alignment): Arrow keys, drag with mouse, or you can right click and chose align.
    6. Consistent Node Layout: Keep smaller nodes organized in a consistent manner.
    7.  Make Functions: You can create functions to make nodes less overwhelming. We can also create local variables for them.
    8. Collapse Nodes: Hides Nodes in one collapsed node area.
    9.  Set Timer by function name: Kind of works like a delay for functions.
    10. Select Node: Change variables only once.
    11. Comments: Super Useful, TEMP, FIXME, TODO, OPTIMIZE
    12. Custom Events: Super useful work like functions and allow us to get nodes in the same blueprint in its own section.
    13. Actor Components: Useful for shared functionality.
    14. Blueprint Function  Libraries: Functionality not tied to one object, kind of like utility functions. Can be called from all blueprints.
    15. Parents/Child Inheritance: Can Make changes to a child that has same properties as parent, but you can make changes to its mesh and more.
    
## WandB Effective MLOps:

- I started watching all the WandB videos for Effective MLOps.
- The focus of this course will be three different parts: the first part which is developing a simple baseline, then optimizing our solution, and finally we'll evaluate our models.
    - First Video: Frame opportunity as machine learning model. Explaratory data analysis after we have gathered our data. Then we have to decide what metrics we want to track and optimize and develop a simple solution. We want to have active communication. 
    - Second Video: pip install wandb -qq. We'll need o also import fastai.vision.all and params. We can create a table with wand.Table(columns=["File_Name", "P1", "P2", "Images", "Dataset"] + labels). Starts a run to allow computation with run = wandb.init(project=params.WANDB_PROJECT, entityparams.ENTITY, job_type="upload"). For an artifact it's a folder containing our data with artifact = wandb.Artifact(params.RAW_DATA_AT, type="raw_data"). artifact.add_file(path/"License.txt", name="License.txt"). Add folders to artifact with artifact.add_dir(path/"images", name="images") and artifact.add_dir(path/'labels', name='labels'). table= _create_table(image_files, params.BDD_CLASSES) Next we must add table to artifact log the artifact and finish the run.
    - Third Video: in artifacts tab we have man tools to look in detail at our data. Table allows us to look at our images. Segemntation tasks requires each pixel to be identified. We can create reports to document data. We can note down what attributes from each p seems to look like and what we need to pay attention to. We can add tables to our reports
    - Fourth Video: good pratice so save work of wandb to use it later. We can use the artifact to download it and save locally. Split data with EDA table. Add a table column for rare data. We can create a new artifact to store this data. Create a dataframe for a new eda table. Join it with eda, log it, and run.
    - Fifth Video: Import fastai.callback.wandb import wandbcallback. Artifacts to track the data lineage for our model.wandb.config to set up hyperparameters. 
    - Sixth Video: Summary of our first task in building a prototype. WandB tables allows us to visualize and analyze model predictions. Artifacts allow us to track lineanage of our data. Wand to record model training. Ensure that we write reports.

    - Second Lesson:
    - Learn how to optimize our model while increasing output but reducing effort
    - Learned how to get code and model from team members and get it running on our system.
    - Refactoring code refers to the process of restructuring code in a way without changing or adding to its behaviour
    - Sweeps helps with hyperparameter tuning efficiently.
    - table view and grouping by architecture makes it easier to understand and digest metrics for sweep analysis. 
    - We can use grouping, sorting, and filtering to analyze large groups of data.
    - We should use sweeps to automate hyperparameter training

    - Third Lesson: will be about data partioning, evaluation metrics, error analysis, and also documenting models.
    - Trying to prevent data leakage and ensuring we partition data correctly.
    - It's important to pick only one metric that is a single-number.
    - Person iou: intersection over union (ratio) have to be aware of imbalances
    - Model Registry allows to track and transition state of models across the lifecycle, from training, through evaluation, testing and production.
    - To evalutate models you can create an evaluation run with job_type being evaluation.
    - Error analysis is important because it allows you to see what truths may be causing errors in your models.
    - If metrics on test set are very different you must look into whether data was split in the right way, is the dataset that was split different from the other data, or is there a lot of noise? If you find an issue and decide to use another model you must completely restart and re-partition your data.
# Issues

- Even if we try to run the wandb code, we are unable to. Everytime we try to login to it we get an error that says permission denied. PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/tmp/.config/wandb/tmps41l9oko.tmp'
- I tried packaging the games as the blueprint is working with our current ue5osc python script, but got that the packaging failed. UATHelper: Packaging (Windows): ERROR: System.ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added. Key: GitSourceControl
PackagingResults: Error: System.ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added. Key: GitSourceControl

[Error]
# Plans
    
- I plan to package the game for Mac and Windows and get it working for Mac
