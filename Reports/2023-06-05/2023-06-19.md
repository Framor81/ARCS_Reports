# Summary

| Date  | Notes
| :---- | :----
| 06/12 | I continued trying to fix the collision of the mesh, got all assets on the robot as intended, followed chaos tutorial videos, created the needed blueprints and had to mess around with the Inputs for a while because it was not allowing my simple robot to move, and I eventually got the robot moving.
| 06/13 | I continued researching and watching videos on making a blueprint to control the wheel separately, helped Anjali finish setting up a simple chaos vehicle, downloaded the Oldenborg model and tried to get it working, watched fastai video 3, and looked more into depth into some of its definitions. 

# Activities

- I fixed the collision and static mesh of our robot
- Followed tutorials on getting a chaos vehicle moving
- Debugging blueprints and getting the vehicle working properly
- Helped Anjali set up a chaos vehicle
- Attempted to import Liz's Oldenborg model but failed
- Watched FastAI video 3
- Read more documentation over topics discussed in video 3
- Researched how to get differential drive in vehicles
- Explored the idea of creating my own blueprints, but quickly shifted away from that
- Looked through forum posts and youtube videos
- Had a whole team meeting where we discussed our progress from the past week.
    - Showed off the working chaos vehicle
- Created a separate blueprint and component for the left and right wheel to be able to move separately
    - remapped another set of buttons to be used for the left wheel by itself
    - Helped Anjali debug her blueprint and get to the same point
- Met with clark and discussed next possible steps for the blueprint
    - I started working on a way to get the wheels to not move on an incline/coast.


## Simple Robot Continued
- I continued fixing the collision and the static mesh of our simple robot and finally got it working and on the floor as intended.
- Regenerated the primitive shapes to avoid collision on empty air

- Continued following the tutorials and got to the point where I finished watching along. However, the blueprint would not work with my controls. 
- I looked for solutions and found a tutorial which recommended using the third person controls so I downloaded them and used them as a reference for my blueprint.

- Tried using gamepad in case it was the keyboard input which was not working; however, the problem persisted.
- I finally fixed the issue by restarting my blueprint. I was able to get a functioning robot controller that worked.

- I then tried focusing in making this blueprint work in a sort of tank tread style
- I looked up tutorials in blueprints to become more comfortable with them and create one of my own for differential drive.

## Attempt at Opening Liz's Oldenborg model
- I downloaded the whole repository and then tried directly importing that folder into unreal engine 5.
- However, I kept getting so many errors that were easy to fix with some installation and restarting my computer.

# Issues
- The wheel of my simple robot asset kept disappearing

- Engine Input is now deprecated, so I thought I had to find out how to use the new enhanced input actions to use chaos vehicle; however, I got the normal inputs working through restarting my blueprint from scratch. 
- Prompted to download Visual Studio 2022 in order to be able to open the project; however, once I downloaded it told me I was missing a necessary component so I installed it, and had to restart my computer.
- It finally compiled but once it opened the whole scene was empty.
