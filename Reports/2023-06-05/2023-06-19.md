# Summary

| 06/12 | I continued trying to fix the collision of the mesh, got all assets on the robot as intended, followed chaos tutorial videos, created the needed blueprints and had to mess around with the Inputs for a while because it was not allowing my simple robot to move, and I eventually got the robot moving.

# Activities
- I continued fixing the collision and the static mesh of our simple robot.

- Continued following the tutorials and got to the point where I finished watching along. However, the blueprint would not work with my controls. 
- I looked for solutions and found a tutorial which recommended using the third person controls so I downloaded them and used them as a reference for my blueprint.

- Tried using gamepad in case it was the keyboard input which was not working; however, the problem persisted.
- I finally fixed the issue by restarting my blueprint. I was able to get a functioning robot controller that worked.

- I then tried focusing in making this blueprint work in a sort of tank tread style

# Issues
- The wheel of my simple robot asset kept disappearing

- Engine Input is now deprecated, so I thought I had to find out how to use the new enhanced input actions to use chaos vehicle; however, I got the normal inputs working through restarting my blueprint from scratch.
