| :---- | :----
| 07/17 | Had a whole team meeting where we discussed the iGibson 2.0 article, explained how boxnav work, and how we can use it/set it up, worked on updating the readme for boxnav, met with Anjali and further discussed ideas for Wednesday, uploaded zoom meetings, committed changes to ue5osc and boxnav as requested from Prof Clark, before focusing on the blueprint and getting switching texture's working without development mode.
| 07/18 | Had a meeting with Chau and Daisy about creating a wandB artifact, continued working on trying to get cross blueprint communication before shifting focus, and instead packing the game for mac and window and committing all my changes to github, Anjali and I then addressed the suggestions to change the filename, I then wanted to collected more data by creating multiple runs to collect images, Anjali and I then spent the rest of the day practicing for our presentation, recording and editing a demo video as well as uploading it.
| 07/19 | Had a team meeting with Oliver and the UCSC team where Anjali and I presented what our research has been so far, as well as demoed our project, Anjali and I then began working on a system to allow multiple runs with an argument, Prof Clark then helped us revise this code and improve upon it, I then created a large dataset with over 1800 images and uploaded it as an artifact to wandb, I then spent some time watching the OSC Youtube videos, and modeling Edmunds in blender.

# Activities

- Had a whole team meeting where we discussed the iGibson paper.
    - We talked about why we are working on our research and how our research differs from other robotic research on the same topic.
- Eventually put some people and or change more things in the environment and see how our neural network/machine learning model reacts.
- See what changes in the environment will cause it to act erratically or be prone to errors.
- We talked about unsupervised learning and how it works in assigning points.
- Get wandB working, and understanding it. every 20 steps, training some models, some inference on a really bad model
- After the main whole group meeting, Daisy, Chau, Anjali, and I stayed in the call where we went over all of the code in boxnav, explained how it generally works as well as some of the lower level details. 
    - We then ran the code and showed how it's supposed to function
    - Prof Clark, then showed everyone how they should go about creating an env to allow anyone to run boxsim.py
    - Chau then stayed in the call and helped me identify where the game.ini file could be located on Mac
- I then started working on the README in boxnav.

- Met with Chau and Daisy. We worked out how to create an artifact and uploaded it to wandb teams.
    - Recorded and put into box
- Kept trying to figure out how to use blueprint to change the texture without console; however, eventually had to give up due to not understanding the object needed.
- I packaged the current version of unreal engine and committed my files into github, as to start collecting data.
- Anjali and I then worked on changing the filename in boxnav to include the degree instead of the previous action taken.
- We shifted focus to practicing our presentation for tomorrow's meeting 
    - We recorded and edited our demo project to present tomorrow.
- Furthermore I started exploring a way to have multiple runs of the environment in order to allow us to gather bigger datasets.

# Issues

- After modeling Edmunds in Blender, I had an issue with collisions where every time I walked into the model, the model would start to glitch out.

# Plans

- Split up OSC and the pawn
    - Then make an interace to communicate with all 3.
