# Activities

- Had a whole team meeting where we discussed the iGibson paper.
    - We talked about why we are working on our research and how our research differs from other robotic research on the same topic.
- Eventually put some people and or change more things in the environment and see how our neural network/machine learning model reacts.
- See what changes in the environment will cause it to act erratically or be prone to errors.
- We talked about unsupervised learning and how it works in assigning points.
- Get wandB working, and understanding it. every 20 steps, training some models, some inference on a really bad model
- After the main whole group meeting, Daisy, Chau, Anjali, and I stayed in the call where we went over all of the code in boxnav, explained how it generally works as well as some of the lower level details. 
    - We then ran the code and showed how it's supposed to function
    - Prof Clark, then showed everyone how they should go about creating an env to allow anyone to run boxsim.py
    - Chau then stayed in the call and helped me identify where the game.ini file could be located on Mac
- I then started working on the README in boxnav.

- Python would have to know where the executable is. Possible to just change the port through unreal engine.
    - If someone wants to specify their port they need the give the executable path

- Quality = /set/quality
- switch to /toggle
