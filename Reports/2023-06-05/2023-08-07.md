# Summary

| Date  | Notes
| :---- | :----
| 07/31 | Read and reviewed Image+Command Code, documented all of the repositories that we have worked on over the summer, worked with Prof Clark to try to debug some issues as well as review the progress that we had made last week, and then I tried addressing some issues in boxnav.
| 08/01 | I read an article that is similar to our use of unreal engine to train a virtual agent, but a lot of it went over my head but I will hopefully reread it and internalize more of what they were discussing. I then worked on boxnav and improved the wandering navigator to be more consistent by adding a method that only allowed movement within the simulated env boxes.
| 08/02 | Had a whole team meeting where we discussed our plans, met with Clark and got some direction for what to work on, started messing around with a teleporting navigator.
| 08/03 |  Continued trying to get a teleporting navigator working.

# Activities

- Continued reading Christy's comment on the Image+command code and reviewed what this training script was actually trying to do. 
- Following some time spent trying to debug with no success, I shifted my focus to documenting all the repositories that we worked on over the summer, what each file contained within these repositories did, and how to use them.
- Next, I spent some time with Prof Clark, addressing some of the issues I had last week as well as showing the progress that we have made.
    - I then started looking at boxnav and trying to create a function that only allows movement in the box where it's current target is in.

- I read an article over the use of unreal engine in the tracking the trajectory of a biomimetic robotic fish. This article was called
    - LQR Control and Optimization for Trajectory Tracking of Biomimetic Robotic Fish Based on Unreal Engine by Ming Wang, Kunlun Wang , Qianchuan Zhao, Xuehan Zheng, He Gao, and Junzhi Yu and was published June 4, 2023.
    - Overall the article, is similar in the aspect that we both built simulation through unreal engine and use virtual agents to train and collect data; however, their methods are much more methodical and reliant on mathematic equations and algorithms to better understand the behavior and trajectory of their biomimetic fish.
- Tried adding the function that will only allow movements inside of the box with the target inside; however, by changing the code I made it so the navigator is able to fully escape the boxes.
- The problem was addressed by reworking the take_action function in the navigator to set a flag as True 
- I then got another error when trying to move forward where it wouldn't move forward no matter what. I was able to fix this, by realizing that this endless loop of forward commands was from an invalid movement outside the boxes causing us to never go inside of our conditional that checked how many invalid actions had been ran. I fixed this by adding an else that will still prevent invalid movements to places outside the target boxes.
- I finally ran this code and it worked much more consistentyl; however, to be more consistent I still made a lot of the hallways skinnier so that we wouldn't have a situation where the agent and robot got stuck behind a pillar or corner.
- I then went and added a few more details into the Readme doc over all of our repositories 

- For the teleporting navigator I had a few approaches:
    - The first of which was based on the agent's current location and rotation  we would draw a rectangle in front of it. However, I realized since we plan to randomly change the rotation of the agent this would not work.
    - My second approach was to make a method in the navigator base class that determines what direction the agent is supposed to move to get to the next target. I plan to use this in order to allow teleportation in this direction. 
    - I finally got the rectangles drawn exactly how I wanted. I just need to make some minor adjustments to only draw the rectangle inside of the already drawn box.


# Issues
    - A lot of trial and error with the teleport navigator; however, I do feel a lot more confident in my ability to use the box environment.

# Plans

- Wandering that everytime we have a stuck command if it would be helpful to label this image as stuck, so that our robot has less bias and maybe even knows how to deal with images where it is just facing the wall.
- I want to get the teleporting navigator to actually draw boxes in the desired location and then place the robot anywhere inside of the newly drawn box with a random rotation.
- I could improve teleport by grabbing the height and width of the current box and then drawing a rectangle of the same size as that based on the upper, left, and right coordinates. Maybe adding or subtracting some values to make the rectangle smaller or skinnier.
