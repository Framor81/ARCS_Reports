# Activities

- Continued reading Christy's comment on the Image+command code and reviewed what this training script was actually trying to do. 
- Following some time spent trying to debug with no success, I shifted my focus to documenting all the repositories that we worked on over the summer, what each file contained within these repositories did, and how to use them.
- Next, I spent some time with Prof Clark, addressing some of the issues I had last week as well as showing the progress that we have made.
    - I then started looking at boxnav and trying to create a function that only allows movement in the box where it's current target is in.
