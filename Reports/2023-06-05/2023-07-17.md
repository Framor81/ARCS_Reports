# Activities

- I began looking into ways to add more custom settings into GameUserSettings.ini file and I found a way using C++. I decided to try to implement it following along with this YouTube tutorial. It ended up working; however, when I tried packaging the game for windows it ended up taking an incredibly long time. 
- I got an unknown Cook failure when packaging the game, so I shifted to trying to see how I could make it into a plugin. Prof Clark, then recommended I shift focuses away from that since a plugin would require the team to have to download the same sdk and make the workflow more complicated.
- I added a second camera to the pawn where we could chose between two options. One where the robot is in the view and one where it is not. Originally, I had this system working with adding an offset to the camera, but Clark's recommendation was more concise so I implemented it. 
- I added an option to change the graphics quality with the press of comma to decrease the graphic settings, and period to increase the graphics quality. These options allow 4 different graphics settings.
- I then started reading more documentation and watching youtube tutorials on getting custom game settings readable through blueprints. Unfortunately, I haven't found anything just yet.
- I decided to look into the screenshots not being saved where we wanted them, and after comparing my osc code (where screenshots were saved where ever I wanted) and the boxnav code I found that the filepath was off by including a backslash instead of a slash in separating the folder and filename. After I fixed this, Anjali pushed and commited the changes. 

# Issues

- I was having a problem where the command to switch between camera views wasn't working on the first attempt, but would work normally after the second try. I fixed this by setting the camera without the robot as inactive at the very beginning of the game.
