| 07/24 | Had a whole group meeting with Daisy, Chau, Anjali, and Ella. In this meeting we went over the code and objectives in the OldenborgTraining repository. Here we also split up the work between 2 groups. Anjali and I decided to focus on fixing the wandering navigator and getting us less likely to get stuck

# Activities

- Need to work on inference.py to actually be able to make the agent act on our NN decisions.
- Fix the wandering path to work as intended.
- Work on training.py to create a model that works with the Image+Command model.
- Ella, Chau, and Daisy will work on getting the server GPU's working and coding an Image+Command model
- Anjali and I will work on the boxnav wandering navigator and get it work as intended.
- Continued working on boxnav and fixed the ValueError from happening when the robot tried going outside of the circle. We simply commented out this line since if it failed anyway, it's position wouldn't be updated. Furthermore, since UE wouldn't move if this was the case the robots would still stay synced.

- Had a whole team meeting again with Chau, Daisy, and Ella. In this meeting we discussed our progress from what we did yesterday. It was short meeting, but insightful as to what we were each working on.
- Once again today, I continued attempting to make the wandering navigator a bit more consistent with being able to reach the finish. 
    - The first thing the I decided to address were the problem areas. These problem areas where places where the robot would like wandering into the corners and getting stuck. To fix these problem areas, I placed an invisible wall that should prevent the unreal robot from continuously thinking it was a valid path.
    - Next, I realized the certain places in the boxsim env were treated as being valid paths when in reality they were actually inside the walls or out of bounds. To fix this, I made some of the hallways a bit skinnier in the boxsim.
    - Another thing that I did was increase the opportunities for invalid actions to 10 instead of just 5 to see if it would lead to us reaching a valid move.      
    - Furthermore, I fixed the method call for syncing the boxsim agent to unreal agent, so the Boxsim agent wouldn't make a move away from the actual robot.

- Anjali and I then began to focus on getting inference.py to work with a simple model. 
    - The first step in assigning pictures to the ones we took in unreal engine was pretty simple, and then following this we implemented a way to pull a requested image and have a model make a prediction on what we should do next, which worked.

# Issues

- While running the new wandering navigator I noticed a few issues:
    - The robot camera could sometimes clip through the walls and see right through them. I can fix this by decreasing the movement forward by a fixed amount if its raycast hits something, or I can move the camera a bit further back.
    - Although we reset correctly, it resets to often, rarely getting to the final target. Out of 15 trials only 4 of them ever made it to the target
        - Maybe this can be fixed by adding some invisible walls that can prevent the wandering robot going into positions it is prone to getting stuck inside of.
