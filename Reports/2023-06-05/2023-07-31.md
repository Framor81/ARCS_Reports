# Summary

| 07/24 | Had a whole group meeting with Daisy, Chau, Anjali, and Ella. In this meeting we went over the code and objectives in the OldenborgTraining repository. Here we also split up the work between 2 groups. Anjali and I decided to focus on fixing the wandering navigator and getting us less likely to get stuck

# Activities

- Need to work on inference.py to actually be able to make the agent act on our NN decisions.
- Fix the wandering path to work as intended.
- Work on training.py to create a model that works with the Image+Command model.
- Ella, Chau, and Daisy will work on getting the server GPU's working and coding an Image+Command model
- Anjali and I will work on the boxnav wandering navigator and get it work as intended.
- Continued working on boxnav and fixed the ValueError from happening when the robot tried going outside of the circle. We simply commented out this line since if it failed anyway, it's position wouldn't be updated. Furthermore, since UE wouldn't move if this was the case the robots would still stay synced.

- Had a whole team meeting again with Chau, Daisy, and Ella. In this meeting we discussed our progress from what we did yesterday.             

# Issues

- While running the new wandering navigator I noticed a few issues:
    - The robot camera could sometimes clip through the walls and see right through them. I can fix this by decreasing the movement forward by a fixed amount if its raycast hits something, or I can move the camera a bit further back.
    - Although we reset correctly, it resets to often, rarely getting to the final target. Out of 15 trials only 4 of them ever made it to the target
        - Maybe this can be fixed by adding some invisible walls that can prevent the wandering robot going into positions it is prone to getting stuck inside of.
